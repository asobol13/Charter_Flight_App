### The end goal:
***
The end goal of this program is to have both a user and admin side. I would like to implement even more features that could help the fbos or charter businesses in the aviation industry. Things like the maintenance schedule for the planes, a calendar to keep track of all of the events, the ability for customers to create an account to take care of billing or any specific documents, among many other things that could help the various processes that go into this part of the aviation industry.
